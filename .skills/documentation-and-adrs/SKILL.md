# Documentation and ADRs

## Overview

Document decisions, not just code. The most valuable documentation captures the *why* — the context, constraints, and trade-offs that led to a decision. Code shows *what* was built; documentation explains *why it was built this way* and *what alternatives were considered*. This context is essential for future humans and agents working in the codebase.

## When to Use

- Making a significant architectural decision
- Choosing between competing approaches
- Adding or changing a public API
- Shipping a feature that changes user-facing behavior
- Onboarding new team members (or agents) to the project
- When you find yourself explaining the same thing repeatedly
- Writing documentation, proposals, technical specs, or decision docs

**When NOT to use:** Don't document obvious code. Don't add comments that restate what the code already says. Don't write docs for throwaway prototypes.

---

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs capture the reasoning behind significant technical decisions. They're the highest-value documentation you can write.

### When to Write an ADR

- Choosing a framework, library, or major dependency
- Designing a data model or database schema
- Selecting an authentication strategy
- Deciding on an API architecture (REST vs. GraphQL vs. tRPC)
- Choosing between build tools, hosting platforms, or infrastructure
- Any decision that would be expensive to reverse

### ADR Template

Store ADRs in `docs/decisions/` with sequential numbering:

```markdown
# ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL for primary database

## Status
Accepted | Superseded by ADR-XXX | Deprecated

## Date
2025-01-15

## Context
We need a primary database for the task management application. Key requirements:
- Relational data model (users, tasks, teams with relationships)
- ACID transactions for task state changes
- Support for full-text search on task content
- Managed hosting available (for small team, limited ops capacity)

## Decision
Use PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM.

## Alternatives Considered

### MongoDB
- Pros: Flexible schema, easy to start with
- Cons: Our data is inherently relational; would need to manage relationships manually
- Rejected: Relational data in a document store leads to complex joins or data duplication

### SQLite
- Pros: Zero configuration, embedded, fast for reads
- Cons: Limited concurrent write support, no managed hosting for production
- Rejected: Not suitable for multi-user web application in production

### MySQL
- Pros: Mature, widely supported
- Cons: PostgreSQL has better JSON support, full-text search, and ecosystem tooling
- Rejected: PostgreSQL is the better fit for our feature requirements

## Consequences
- Prisma provides type-safe database access and migration management
- We can use PostgreSQL's full-text search instead of adding Elasticsearch
- Team needs PostgreSQL knowledge (standard skill, low risk)
- Hosting on managed service (Supabase, Neon, or RDS)
```

### ADR Lifecycle

```
PROPOSED → ACCEPTED → (SUPERSEDED or DEPRECATED)
```

- **Don't delete old ADRs.** They capture historical context.
- When a decision changes, write a new ADR that references and supersedes the old one.

## Doc Co-Authoring Workflow

A structured workflow for guiding users through collaborative document creation. Three stages: Context Gathering, Refinement & Structure, and Reader Testing.

### When to Offer This Workflow

**Trigger conditions:**
- User mentions writing documentation: "write a doc", "draft a proposal", "create a spec", "write up"
- User mentions specific doc types: "PRD", "design doc", "decision doc", "RFC"
- User seems to be starting a substantial writing task

**Initial offer:**
Offer the user a structured workflow for co-authoring the document. Explain the three stages:
1. **Context Gathering**: User provides all relevant context while asking clarifying questions
2. **Refinement & Structure**: Iteratively build each section through brainstorming and editing
3. **Reader Testing**: Test the doc with a fresh agent (no context) to catch blind spots before others read it

Explain that this approach helps ensure the doc works well when others read it (including when they paste it into an AI assistant). Ask if they want to try this workflow or prefer to work freeform.

If user declines, work freeform. If user accepts, proceed to Stage 1.

### Stage 1: Context Gathering

**Goal:** Close the gap between what the user knows and what the AI knows, enabling smart guidance later.

#### Initial Questions

Start by asking the user for meta-context about the document:
1. What type of document is this? (e.g., technical spec, decision doc, proposal)
2. Who's the primary audience?
3. What's the desired impact when someone reads this?
4. Is there a template or specific format to follow?
5. Any other constraints or context to know?

Inform them they can answer in shorthand or dump information however works best for them.

**If user provides a template or mentions a doc type:**
- Ask if they have a template document to share
- If they provide a link to a shared document, read it
- If they provide a file, read it

**If user mentions editing an existing shared document:**
- Read the current state
- Check for images without alt-text
- If images exist without alt-text, explain that when others use AI to understand the doc, the AI won't be able to see them. Ask if they want alt-text generated.

#### Info Dumping

Once initial questions are answered, encourage the user to dump all the context they have. Request information such as:
- Background on the project/problem
- Related team discussions or shared documents
- Why alternative solutions aren't being used
- Organizational context (team dynamics, past incidents, politics)
- Timeline pressures or constraints
- Technical architecture or dependencies
- Stakeholder concerns

Advise them not to worry about organizing it - just get it all out.

**During context gathering:**
- If user mentions team channels or shared documents, read them if possible
- If user mentions entities/projects that are unknown, ask if connected tools should be searched
- As user provides context, track what's being learned and what's still unclear

#### Asking Clarifying Questions

When user signals they've done their initial dump (or after substantial context provided), ask clarifying questions to ensure understanding:

Generate 5-10 numbered questions based on gaps in the context.

Inform them they can use shorthand to answer (e.g., "1: yes, 2: see #channel, 3: no because backwards compat"), link to more docs, or just keep info-dumping.

**Exit condition:**
Sufficient context has been gathered when questions show understanding - when edge cases and trade-offs can be asked about without needing basics explained.

**Transition:**
Ask if there's any more context they want to provide at this stage, or if it's time to move on to drafting the document.

### Stage 2: Refinement & Structure

**Goal:** Build the document section by section through brainstorming, curation, and iterative refinement.

**Instructions to user:**
Explain that the document will be built section by section. For each section:
1. Clarifying questions will be asked about what to include
2. 5-20 options will be brainstormed
3. User will indicate what to keep/remove/combine
4. The section will be drafted
5. It will be refined through surgical edits

Start with whichever section has the most unknowns (usually the core decision/proposal), then work through the rest.

**Section ordering:**
If the document structure is clear, ask which section they'd like to start with. Suggest starting with whichever section has the most unknowns. For decision docs, that's usually the core proposal. For specs, it's typically the technical approach. Summary sections are best left for last.

If user doesn't know what sections they need, suggest 3-5 sections appropriate for the doc type based on the type of document and template. Ask if this structure works, or if they want to adjust it.

**Once structure is agreed:**
Create the initial document structure with placeholder text for all sections. Create a markdown file in the working directory with all section headers and brief placeholder text like "[To be written]" or "[Content here]".

**For each section:**

#### Step 1: Clarifying Questions
Announce work will begin on the [SECTION NAME] section. Ask 5-10 clarifying questions about what should be included based on context and section purpose.

#### Step 2: Brainstorming
For the [SECTION NAME] section, brainstorm 5-20 things that might be included, depending on the section's complexity. Look for:
- Context shared that might have been forgotten
- Angles or considerations not yet mentioned

Generate 5-20 numbered options based on section complexity.

#### Step 3: Curation
Ask which points should be kept, removed, or combined. Request brief justifications to help learn priorities for the next sections.

Provide examples:
- "Keep 1,4,7,9"
- "Remove 3 (duplicates 1)"
- "Remove 6 (audience already knows this)"
- "Combine 11 and 12"

#### Step 4: Gap Check
Based on what they've selected, ask if there's anything important missing for the [SECTION NAME] section.

#### Step 5: Drafting
Replace the placeholder text for this section with the actual drafted content. Announce the [SECTION NAME] section will be drafted now based on what they've selected.

**Key instruction for user:**
Provide a note: Instead of editing the doc directly, ask them to indicate what to change. This helps learning of their style for future sections. For example: "Remove the X bullet - already covered by Y" or "Make the third paragraph more concise".

#### Step 6: Iterative Refinement
As user provides feedback:
- Make edits using string replacement (never reprint the whole doc)
- Just confirm edits are complete
- If user edits doc directly and asks to read it, note the changes they made and keep them in mind for future sections

**Continue iterating** until user is satisfied with the section.

#### Quality Checking
After 3 consecutive iterations with no substantial changes, ask if anything can be removed without losing important information.

When section is done, confirm [SECTION NAME] is complete. Ask if ready to move to the next section.

**Repeat for all sections.**

#### Near Completion
As approaching completion (80%+ of sections done), announce intention to re-read the entire document and check for:
- Flow and consistency across sections
- Redundancy or contradictions
- Anything that feels like "slop" or generic filler
- Whether every sentence carries weight

Read entire document and provide feedback.

**When all sections are drafted and refined:**
Announce all sections are drafted. Indicate intention to review the complete document one more time for overall coherence, flow, completeness. Provide any final suggestions. Ask if ready to move to Reader Testing, or if they want to refine anything else.

### Stage 3: Reader Testing

**Goal:** Test the document with a fresh AI (no context bleed) to verify it works for readers.

**Instructions to user:**
Explain that testing will now occur to see if the document actually works for readers. This catches blind spots - things that make sense to the authors but might confuse others.

#### Testing Approach

**If access to sub-agents is available:**
Perform the testing directly without user involvement.

**Step 1: Predict Reader Questions**
Announce intention to predict what questions readers might ask when trying to discover this document. Generate 5-10 questions that readers would realistically ask.

**Step 2: Test with Sub-Agent**
Announce that these questions will be tested with a fresh AI instance (no context from this conversation). For each question, invoke a sub-agent with just the document content and the question. Summarize what Reader AI got right/wrong for each question.

**Step 3: Run Additional Checks**
Announce additional checks will be performed. Invoke sub-agent to check for ambiguity, false assumptions, contradictions. Summarize any issues found.

**Step 4: Report and Fix**
If issues found, report that Reader AI struggled with specific issues, list the specific issues, and indicate intention to fix these gaps. Loop back to refinement for problematic sections.

---

**If no access to sub-agents:**
The user will need to do the testing manually.

**Step 1: Predict Reader Questions**
Ask what questions people might ask when trying to discover this document. What would they type into an AI assistant? Generate 5-10 questions that readers would realistically ask.

**Step 2: Setup Testing**
Provide testing instructions:
1. Open a fresh AI conversation
2. Paste or share the document content
3. Ask Reader AI the generated questions

For each question, instruct Reader AI to provide:
- The answer
- Whether anything was ambiguous or unclear
- What knowledge/context the doc assumes is already known

Check if Reader AI gives correct answers or misinterprets anything.

**Step 3: Additional Checks**
Also ask Reader AI:
- "What in this doc might be ambiguous or unclear to readers?"
- "What knowledge or context does this doc assume readers already have?"
- "Are there any internal contradictions or inconsistencies?"

**Step 4: Iterate Based on Results**
Ask what Reader AI got wrong or struggled with. Indicate intention to fix those gaps. Loop back to refinement for any problematic sections.

---

#### Exit Condition (Both Approaches)
When Reader AI consistently answers questions correctly and doesn't surface new gaps or ambiguities, the doc is ready.

### Final Review

When Reader Testing passes:
Announce the doc has passed Reader AI testing. Before completion:
1. Recommend they do a final read-through themselves - they own this document and are responsible for its quality
2. Suggest double-checking any facts, links, or technical details
3. Ask them to verify it achieves the impact they wanted

Ask if they want one more review, or if the work is done.

**If user wants final review, provide it. Otherwise:**
Announce document completion. Provide a few final tips:
- Consider linking this conversation in an appendix so readers can see how the doc was developed
- Use appendices to provide depth without bloating the main doc
- Update the doc as feedback is received from real readers

## Inline Documentation

### When to Comment

Comment the *why*, not the *what*:

```typescript
// BAD: Restates the code
// Increment counter by 1
counter += 1;

// GOOD: Explains non-obvious intent
// Rate limit uses a sliding window — reset counter at window boundary,
// not on a fixed schedule, to prevent burst attacks at window edges
if (now - windowStart > WINDOW_SIZE_MS) {
  counter = 0;
  windowStart = now;
}
```

### When NOT to Comment

```typescript
// Don't comment self-explanatory code
function calculateTotal(items: CartItem[]): number {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
}

// Don't leave TODO comments for things you should just do now
// TODO: add error handling ← Just add it

// Don't leave commented-out code
// const oldImplementation = () => { ... } ← Delete it, git has history
```

### Document Known Gotchas

```typescript
/**
 * IMPORTANT: This function must be called before the first render.
 * If called after hydration, it causes a flash of unstyled content
 * because the theme context isn't available during SSR.
 *
 * See ADR-003 for the full design rationale.
 */
export function initializeTheme(theme: Theme): void {
  // ...
}
```

---

## API Documentation

For public APIs (REST, GraphQL, library interfaces):

### Inline with Types (Preferred for TypeScript)

```typescript
/**
 * Creates a new task.
 *
 * @param input - Task creation data (title required, description optional)
 * @returns The created task with server-generated ID and timestamps
 * @throws {ValidationError} If title is empty or exceeds 200 characters
 * @throws {AuthenticationError} If the user is not authenticated
 *
 * @example
 * const task = await createTask({ title: 'Buy groceries' });
 * console.log(task.id); // "task_abc123"
 */
export async function createTask(input: CreateTaskInput): Promise<Task> {
  // ...
}
```

### OpenAPI / Swagger for REST APIs

```yaml
paths:
  /api/tasks:
    post:
      summary: Create a task
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/CreateTaskInput'
      responses:
        '201':
          description: Task created
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Task'
        '422':
          description: Validation error
```

## Documentation for Agents

Special consideration for AI agent context:
- **CLAUDE.md / rules files** — Document project conventions so agents follow them
- **Spec files** — Keep specs updated so agents build the right thing
- **ADRs** — Help agents understand why past decisions were made (prevents re-deciding)
- **Inline gotchas** — Prevent agents from falling into known traps

---

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The code is self-documenting" | Code shows what. It doesn't show why, what alternatives were rejected, or what constraints apply. |
| "We'll write docs when the API stabilizes" | APIs stabilize faster when you document them. The doc is the first test of the design. |
| "Nobody reads docs" | Agents do. Future engineers do. Your 3-months-later self does. |
| "ADRs are overhead" | A 10-minute ADR prevents a 2-hour debate about the same decision six months later. |
| "Comments get outdated" | Comments on *why* are stable. Comments on *what* get outdated — that's why you only write the former. |

---

## Red Flags

- Architectural decisions with no written rationale
- Public APIs with no documentation or types
- README that doesn't explain how to run the project
- Commented-out code instead of deletion
- TODO comments that have been there for weeks
- No ADRs in a project with significant architectural choices
- Documentation that restates the code instead of explaining intent

---

## Verification

After documenting:
- [ ] ADRs exist for all significant architectural decisions
- [ ] README covers quick start, commands, and architecture overview
- [ ] API functions have parameter and return type documentation
- [ ] Known gotchas are documented inline where they matter
- [ ] No commented-out code remains
- [ ] Rules files (CLAUDE.md etc.) are current and accurate
- [ ] Documents tested with fresh reader (Stage 3 Reader Testing)

---

## Tips for Effective Guidance

**Tone:**
- Be direct and procedural
- Explain rationale briefly when it affects user behavior
- Don't try to "sell" the approach - just execute it

**Handling Deviations:**
- If user wants to skip a stage: Ask if they want to skip this and write freeform
- If user seems frustrated: Acknowledge this is taking longer than expected. Suggest ways to move faster
- Always give user agency to adjust the process

**Context Management:**
- Throughout, if context is missing on something mentioned, proactively ask
- Don't let gaps accumulate - address them as they come up

**Quality over Speed:**
- Don't rush through stages
- Each iteration should make meaningful improvements
- The goal is a document that actually works for readers
